    <h1>Idolsched</h1>
    <p>
      Idolsched is a teambuilder for SIFAS.
    </p><p>
      Teams are currently optimized for unattended autoplay (as if you selected autoplay and put your phone down).
      This means the solver doesn't account for SP activations and never swaps strategies.
      As a result, it undervalues certain cards and accessories. Additional modes are planned to support other play styles.
    </p><p>
      However, the resulting teams generally work fine in most of the game's songs,
      so if you just need a team that will help you survive something, it is probably good enough.
    </p><p>
      For now the most important thing to know is probably that it is missing a lot of features (there are just <i>so many things</i> in this game).
      This is why voltage estimates tend to be <i>very</i> low compared to actual in-game voltage,
      and also causes the teambuilder to undervalue certain cards.
    </p><p>
      The biggest problems are in songs like Ketsui no Hikari that have unusual sources of damage,
      since many are not accounted for; right now, idolsched will probably give you a team with no healer or shielder.
    </p>
    <h1>Miscellaneous notes</h1>
    <p>
      The step count setting corresponds roughly to the number of teams idolsched will test.
      A higher stepcount leads to better results on average, but takes longer to run.
      The algorithm tends to "settle in" after a while,
      so step counts past 10,000 or so will generally just waste time trying very similar teams unless you have <i>a lot</i> of cards.
    </p><p>
      The algorithm is randomized, so pressing "Run" again will usually give you a slightly different team.
    </p><p>
      The solver is weirdly bad at figuring out where to put accessories (I don't understand exactly why), so don't take its accessory advice too seriously,
      but it is a good idea to add your accessories so it doesn't underestimate your stats too much.
    </p><p>
      You can hold Shift and click in the album editor to fast-cycle cards (missing -> idolized -> MLB -> missing).
    </p><p>
      I do happen to be aware that the site is mad ugly and intend to slap some CSS on it at some point,
      but there is much to be done on more critical features.
